	<div class="py-3 flex flex-col gap-y-3">
		<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center">Welcome to My Website!</h2>
		<p class="w-2/5 mx-auto">
			This is a website I'm developing for myself to learn web development, and hopefully in the future to show off some of the (in my opinion) cool projects I've made! It's currently pretty empty, but expect more in the future, when I get up to it!
